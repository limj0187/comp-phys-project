Regions of atoms that have magnetic dipoles pointing in the same direction will have an overall magenetic dipole pointing in that same direction. And when all these regions in the material have their magnetic dipoles aligned, the material is said to be magentised. \n",

    "Consider a 2 dimensional lattice of spins, $S_i$ in which the spins can either point up, $S_i = +1$, or point down, $S_i = -1$. Each spin interacts with its nearest neighbour through the following potential,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "V_i = -Js_is_{i+1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $V_i$ is the potential and $J$ is the exchange energy. $J$ is a measure of the strength of the interaction. We have also set the external magnetic field to $0$ for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall energy of this system is the sum of the potential $V$ over all the spins of the system. This can be seen through the following,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}s_is_{i+1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the magentisation, the average value of the spins can be taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "M = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} s_i\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Boltzmann distribution, the probabilty of observing any given configuration at equilibrium is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(\\text{state}) = \\exp(-\\frac{E}{k_b T}) = \\exp(-{E}{\\beta})\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If $J>0$ and the temperature is low enough, the ground state will be a ferromagnet and all the spins will be aligned.  \n",
    "But if $J<0$ and the temperature is low enough, the ground state will be an antiferromagnet in which all the spins are alternating.\n",

    "\n",
    "The steps to the metropolis algorithm applied to the Ising model is as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first generate a trial state by choosing one spin at random and flipping it.\n",
    "2. Compute the energy of the initial state, $E_{initial}$, and the trial state, $E_{trial}$. We can also calculate their difference, $\\Delta E = E_{trial} - E_{initial}$\n",
    "3. Now we accept or reject the trial state according to the following rules:\n",
    "    1. If $\\Delta E \\leq 0$, the trial state is accepted. \n",
    "    2. If $\\Delta E > 0$, the trial state is accepted with a probability of $e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_b T}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that the Boltzmann distribution allows a state to be in a higher energy state than the ground state, but it is less likely for that to happen. The Metropolis algorithm randomly changes the individual spins such that on average, the probability of a configuration occuring follows the Boltzmann distribution. So we are able to use the Metropolis algorithm to reproduce the Boltzmann distribution."
